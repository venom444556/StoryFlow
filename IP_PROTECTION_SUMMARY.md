## Action Items — Future Protection

### Trademark

| File Intent-to-Use trademark application (Class 9 or 42) | High | $250-350 filing fee | Not started |
| Consider state-level trademark as interim step | Medium | $50-100 | Not started |

**Notes:**
- "StoryFlow" may face conflicts — search before investing in branding
- Class 9: downloadable software; Class 42: SaaS
- Use TM symbol immediately (no registration required)

**Notes:**
- Software patents are difficult and expensive

- 1-year grace period from first public disclosure to file provisional
- Evaluate ROI — copyright + trade secret may be sufficient

### Copyright Registration

| Action | Priority | Est. Cost | Status |
|--------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Register copyright with US Copyright Office | Medium | $65 online | Not started |

## If You Open-Source Later

| Consideration | Recommendation |
|---------------|----------------|
| License choice | MIT or Apache 2.0 for adoption; AGPL if you want to prevent proprietary forks |
| CLA (Contributor License Agreement) | Required if accepting outside contributions — ensures you retain IP rights |
| Dual licensing | Keep commercial license option even if open-source |
| Trademark policy | Separate from code license — name/logo can remain protected |
